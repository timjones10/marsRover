Instructions
Break into teams of 2-3 people, one workstation per team.
Preparation - Each team writes down on paper the 10-20 demo-able user stories (“slices”) they will develop and possibly demo. Each should be doable in 3-8 minutes. No slice is just mockup of UI, creation of a data table or data structure. All demos show real input & output (not test harness).
Discussion - Instructor/facilitator leads discussion of the slices, what is and isn’t acceptable, solicits ways to slice finer.
Development - A fixed time-box of 40 minutes, five 8-minute development sprints, clock does not stop. At the end of each sprint, each team shows its product to another team.

Product
We manufacture a point of sale capable of issuing cash register tickets.

Accept 4 inputs from the user for one or many items : * Label of item * Quantity of item * Price of item * letter state code

With a given 2 letters state code, we can compute the tax rate

With total price (without tax) we can compute a discount see tabular at end of subject.

Output the recipe like :

label of item     Quantity   Unit price   Total price
label of item     Quantity   Unit price   Total price

//-----------------------------------------------------
//Total without taxes                             XXXXX
//Discout X%                                       -YYY
//Tax Y%                                           +ZZZ
//-----------------------------------------------------
Total price                                    XXXXXX
Order value	Discount rate
> 1000	3%
> 5000	5%
> 7000	7%
> 10000	10%
> 50000	15%
//| State | Tax rate | | UT | 6.85% | | NV | 8.00% | | TX | 6.25% | | AL | 4.00% | | CA | 8.25% |
